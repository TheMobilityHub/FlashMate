## 3. Use Cases

### üü¶ Use Case: Input Files and Variant
**Actor**: Developer
**Trigger**: User starts the application

**Main Flow**:
1. User opens the application.
2. Selects or drags & drops **exactly two** `.zip` files.
3. Application verifies file types and counts.
4. User inputs a Car Variant string.
5. Valid files and variant are prepared for processing.

**Exceptions**:
- Less than two or more than two files selected ‚Üí show validation error.
- Non-ZIP files selected ‚Üí show validation error.
- Corrupted or unreadable ZIP file ‚Üí show error message.
- Empty variant input ‚Üí prompt for required field.

---

### üü¶ Use Case: Process and Extract Firmware Files
**Actor**: Developer
**Trigger**: User clicks the **Start** button

**Main Flow**:
1. Application checks for duplicate folders in Database directory.
2. If duplicate detected, shows warning with existing folder path.
3. Application parses the contents of the two ZIP files.
4. Extracts all files into a temporary directory.
5. Filters necessary firmware files (`.hex`, `.s19`, etc.) based on Car Variant.
6. Creates output folder structure under Database folder.
7. If duplicate exists and user clicks Start again, overwrites existing folder.
8. Displays success message and output path.

**Exceptions**:
- No matching firmware files found ‚Üí show warning.
- Output directory inaccessible ‚Üí show error and abort.
- Existing folder locked/in use ‚Üí show error and abort.
- Database folder creation fails ‚Üí show error and abort.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Car Variant-based filtering logic is **TBD** and will be implemented later.

### üü¶ Use Case: Duplicate Folder Detection and Management
**Actor**: Developer
**Trigger**: Before creating output folder structure

**Main Flow**:
1. Application searches Database directory for folders matching the Car Variant name.
2. If matching folder found, application retrieves folder information:
   - Full path
   - Creation date
   - Last modification date
   - Number of files inside
   - Total folder size
3. Application displays detailed duplicate warning dialog with:
   - Existing folder information
   - Options: "Overwrite", "Create New", "Cancel"
4. User selects action:
   - **Overwrite**: Delete existing folder and proceed
   - **Create New**: Generate unique folder name (e.g., "Variant_20241201_143022")
   - **Cancel**: Abort the operation
5. Application logs the decision and proceeds accordingly.

**Exceptions**:
- Database directory not accessible ‚Üí show error and abort.
- Unable to read existing folder information ‚Üí show basic warning and continue.
- User cancels operation ‚Üí return to main interface.
- Folder deletion fails during overwrite ‚Üí show error and abort.

### üü¶ Use Case: Search and Browse Existing Projects
**Actor**: Developer
**Trigger**: User clicks "Browse Database" or similar button

**Main Flow**:
1. Application scans Database directory for all project folders.
2. Displays search results in a table/list format showing:
   - Project name (Car Variant)
   - Creation date
   - Last modified date
   - Number of firmware files
   - Total project size
3. User can:
   - Sort results by any column
   - Filter by date range
   - Search by project name
   - Open selected project folder
   - Delete selected project (with confirmation)
4. Application provides summary statistics:
   - Total projects in database
   - Total storage used
   - Oldest and newest projects

**Exceptions**:
- Database directory not found ‚Üí create empty database and show message.
- Permission denied accessing database ‚Üí show error message.
- Corrupted project folders ‚Üí mark as "Error" in list and skip.
- Search operation times out ‚Üí show partial results with warning.

### üü¶ Use Case: View Results and Manage Output
**Actor**: Developer
**Trigger**: After processing completes

**Main Flow**:
1. Output folder path is displayed on the screen.
2. User clicks "Open Folder" button to launch the system file explorer.
3. Log/status area displays process summary, warnings, and any errors.
4. User clicks **"New Task"** button to reset the GUI and clear previous results.

**Exceptions**:
- Output folder not found or permission denied ‚Üí show error message.
- Reset fails due to locked resources ‚Üí show error and suggest app restart.

---

### üü¶ Use Case: Real-time Status and Logging
**Actor**: Developer
**Trigger**: During any major operation

**Main Flow**:
1. Application shows real-time status messages (validation, extraction, success/failure).
2. Errors and warnings are clearly displayed in the log area.
3. Status text is color-coded and timestamped for better readability.
4. Duplicate folder warnings include existing folder path and modification date.

**Exceptions**:
- Log display fails ‚Üí continue processing with minimal feedback.
