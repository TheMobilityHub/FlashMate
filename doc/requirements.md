## 3. Use Cases

### üü¶ Use Case: Input Files and Variant
**Actor**: Developer  
**Trigger**: User starts the application  

**Main Flow**:
1. User opens the application.
2. Selects or drags & drops **exactly two** `.zip` files.
3. Application verifies file types and counts.
4. User inputs a Car Variant string.
5. Valid files and variant are prepared for processing.

**Exceptions**:
- Less than two or more than two files selected ‚Üí show validation error.
- Non-ZIP files selected ‚Üí show validation error.
- Corrupted or unreadable ZIP file ‚Üí show error message.
- Empty variant input ‚Üí prompt for required field.

---

### üü¶ Use Case: Process and Extract Firmware Files
**Actor**: Developer  
**Trigger**: User clicks the **Start** button  

**Main Flow**:
1. Application checks for duplicate folders in Database directory.
2. If duplicate detected, shows warning with existing folder path.
3. Application parses the contents of the two ZIP files.
4. Extracts all files into a temporary directory.
5. Filters necessary firmware files (`.hex`, `.s19`, etc.) based on Car Variant.
6. Creates output folder structure under Database folder.
7. If duplicate exists and user clicks Start again, overwrites existing folder.
8. Displays success message and output path.

**Exceptions**:
- No matching firmware files found ‚Üí show warning.
- Output directory inaccessible ‚Üí show error and abort.
- Existing folder locked/in use ‚Üí show error and abort.
- Database folder creation fails ‚Üí show error and abort.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Car Variant-based filtering logic is **TBD** and will be implemented later.

### üü¶ Use Case: View Results and Manage Output
**Actor**: Developer  
**Trigger**: After processing completes  

**Main Flow**:
1. Output folder path is displayed on the screen.
2. User clicks "Open Folder" button to launch the system file explorer.
3. Log/status area displays process summary, warnings, and any errors.
4. User clicks **"New Task"** button to reset the GUI and clear previous results.

**Exceptions**:
- Output folder not found or permission denied ‚Üí show error message.
- Reset fails due to locked resources ‚Üí show error and suggest app restart.

---

### üü¶ Use Case: Real-time Status and Logging
**Actor**: Developer  
**Trigger**: During any major operation  

**Main Flow**:
1. Application shows real-time status messages (validation, extraction, success/failure).
2. Errors and warnings are clearly displayed in the log area.
3. Status text is color-coded and timestamped for better readability.
4. Duplicate folder warnings include existing folder path and modification date.

**Exceptions**:
- Log display fails ‚Üí continue processing with minimal feedback.
